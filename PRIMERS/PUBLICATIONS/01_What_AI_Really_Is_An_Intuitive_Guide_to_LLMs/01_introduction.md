# Booklet Title
What AI Really Is: An Intuitive Guide to LLMs

## Section Title
1. Introduction: What is 'Thinking' for a Computer?

## url_slug
`primer/intro-what-is-ai`

## Short Question
In plain language, what does it mean for an AI to be 'smart,' and what are its biggest strengths and weaknesses?

## Long-Form Guidance Question
Provide a deeply intuitive, high-level, and analogy-rich introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs) for a complete beginner, assuming zero technical knowledge. The primary goal is to build a conceptual 'feel' for AI, not a technical definition. This prompt *must* strictly avoid *all* jargon (e.g., 'parameters', 'training', 'architecture', 'model'). Instead, explain: (1) What 'smart' means for a computer, using an analogy like 'a world-class parrot' or 'a predictive autocomplete'. (2) How machines 'learn' from 'patterns' (e.g., 'reading all the books in a library to see which words most often appear together'). (3) Critically, explain *why* LLMs don't 'think' or 'feel' like humans, but are 'prediction engines' for text. (4) Use a simple, real-world metaphor to explain 'hallucinations' (e.g., 'when a student confidently guesses an answer instead of saying "I don't know"'). (5) Explain *why* the data an AI 'reads' is so important (e.g., 'if it only reads sad books, it will have a sad view of the world'). (6) Conclude by defining the core 'strength' (e.g., 'summarizing, rephrasing') vs. 'weakness' (e.g., 'not understanding truth', 'no common sense') in plain, non-technical language.
