Intro to RAG: Helping AI Learn From Your Information

## Section Title
1. Introduction: The 'Open-Book Test' for AI

## url_slug
`primer/rag-open-book-analogy`

## Short Question
How can AI answer using my own documents first, like taking an open-book test?

## Long-Form Guidance Question
Provide a high-level, conceptual explanation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). You *must* strictly avoid *all* technical terms: `RAG`, `vector`, `database`, `index`, `chunking`, `retrieval`. (1) You *must* use the 'Open-Book vs. Closed-Book Test' analogy (e.g., 'A normal AI is taking a test from 'memory' (a 'closed-book' test). A RAG AI is taking an 'open-book' test—it can 'look up' the answers in *your* documents first'). (2) Explain 'document breaking' with a metaphor (e.g., 'The AI can't read your 500-page book all at once. So, its 'assistant' (the 'retriever') first 'shreds' the book into 'individual pages' or 'paragraphs''). (3) Explain 'search' with a metaphor (e.g., 'When you ask a question, the 'assistant' 'searches' through all the 'shredded pages' and finds the *one* or *two* 'pages' that have the answer'). (4) Explain *why* this is useful (e.g., 'It lets the AI 'know' about your private files' and 'it helps the AI provide *citations* ('the answer came from page 52')').
