## Section Title
1. Introduction: Being a 'Responsible Pilot' for AI

## url_slug
`primer/safety-responsible-pilot`

## Short Question
What does responsible AI use look like for beginners, especially around bias, privacy, and made-up answers?

## Long-Form Guidance Question
Provide a high-level, conceptual guide to AI safety, ethics, and responsible use. You *must not* use 'industry' terms like `guardrails`, `adversarial attacks`, `jailbreaks`, or `red-teaming`. (1) You *must* use the 'AI as a powerful 'engine', but *you* are the 'pilot'' analogy. (2) Explain 'Bias' in simple terms (e.g., 'If the AI *only* 'reads' books 'written by men' (the 'data'), it will 'learn' a *biased* view of the world'). (3) Explain 'Data Safety' (e.g., 'Don't put your *private medical records* or *company secrets* into a 'public' AI. It's like 'shouting your secret' in a 'public park'. The AI 'learns' from it.'). (4) Explain 'Responsible Use' (e.g., 'Don't use an AI to 'write a mean email' or 'do something harmful'. *You* (the 'pilot') are *responsible* for 'where the 'engine' goes'.'). (5) Explain 'Fake but Confident Answers' (hallucinations) as the '#1 safety-risk' for a beginner (e.g., 'The AI *will* 'make up' a 'fact' and 'sound 100% confident'. *Always* 'verify'.').
