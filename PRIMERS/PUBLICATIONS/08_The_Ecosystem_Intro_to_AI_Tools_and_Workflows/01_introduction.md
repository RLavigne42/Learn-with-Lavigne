# Booklet Title
The Ecosystem: Intro to AI Tools & Workflows

## Section Title
1. Introduction: The 'AI Restaurant' - What Happens Behind the Scenes

## url_slug
`primer/ecosystem-restaurant-analogy`

## Short Question
Using a restaurant metaphor, what are the major parts of an AI app and how do cloud vs local setups differ?

## Long-Form Guidance Question
Provide a high-level, metaphorical explanation of the 'AI Tech Stack' for a complete non-technical beginner. You *must not* use terms like `Python`, `frameworks`, `servers`, or `containers`. (1) You *must* use the 'Restaurant Analogy': (a) The **'App'** (on your phone) is the **'Menu'** (the 'front-end'). (b) The **'API'** (the 'messenger') is the **'Waiter'** (who 'takes your order' (the 'prompt') 'to the kitchen'). (c) The **'AI Model'** (in 'the cloud') is the **'Kitchen'** (the 'back-end', where the 'work' is done). (2) Explain 'Cloud' vs. 'Local' (e.g., 'Cloud = a giant, professional 'kitchen' (e.g., Google's) that is very powerful but 'public'. Local = a 'small kitchen' on 'your own computer', which is 'slower' but 'private'). (3) Explain 'Enterprise AI' (e.g., 'a 'kitchen' built to serve 'an entire city') vs. 'Personal AI' (e.g., 'a 'kitchen' just for 'your family').
