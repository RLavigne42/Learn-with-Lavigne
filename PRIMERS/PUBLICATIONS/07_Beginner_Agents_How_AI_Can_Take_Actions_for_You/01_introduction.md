# Booklet Title
Beginner Agents: How AI Can Take Actions for You

## Section Title
1. Introduction: Giving the AI 'Hands' to Help You

## url_slug
`primer/agents-ai-with-hands`

## Short Question
What changes when AI is connected to tools so it can take actions, and where should human approval fit?

## Long-Form Guidance Question
Provide an intuitive, conceptual introduction to 'AI Agents'. You *must not* use terms like `ReAct`, `LangGraph`, `orchestration`, or `state-machine`. (1) You *must* use the 'Brain vs. Hands' analogy (e.g., 'A normal LLM is just a 'brain' in a jar—it can 'think' (predict text), but it can't *do* anything. An 'Agent' is the 'brain' *connected to 'hands'* (the 'tools')'). (2) Explain 'tools' with simple examples (e.g., 'a 'search-the-web' tool', 'a 'use-the-calculator' tool', 'a 'write-an-email' tool'). (3) Provide a simple, step-by-step example of an 'agentic' task (e.g., 'User: "What's the weather in Paris and email it to my mom?" -> Agent Step 1: 'Use search tool' -> Agent Step 2: 'Get "80 degrees"' -> Agent Step 3: 'Use email tool' to 'draft email to Mom'). (4) Explain 'human approval' as a 'safety-latch' (e.g., 'The agent 'drafts' the email, but it *waits for you* to 'click-send'').
