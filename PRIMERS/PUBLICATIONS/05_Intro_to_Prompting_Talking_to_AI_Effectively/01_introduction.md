## Section Title
1. Introduction: The 'Recipe' for a Good AI Answer

## url_slug
`primer/prompting-basics`

## Short Question
What are the practical rules for writing better prompts, and how should beginners iterate when answers are weak?

## Long-Form Guidance Question
Provide a practical, beginner-friendly 'how-to' guide for writing effective prompts. This must be a 'recipe book' of simple, actionable rules, with *no* advanced concepts like 'flows' or 'programmatic' design. (1) Provide *concrete examples* of 'Bad Prompts' vs. 'Good Prompts' (e.g., 'Bad: "Write about dogs". Good: "Write a 3-paragraph summary for a 5th grader on why Golden Retrievers are good family pets."'). (2) Explain 'giving the AI a role' (e.g., 'Act as a professional food critic and review this restaurant...'). (3) Explain 'giving constraints' (e.g., '...in one paragraph', '...in a friendly tone', '...for a beginner'). (4) Explain 'providing examples' (e.g., 'I want a summary in this format: Topic: ... Summary: ...'). (5) Most importantly, explain 'iteration' (e.g., 'Don't give up. If you get a bad answer, don't just ask the same thing. *Rephrase* your question, be *more specific*, and try again.').
