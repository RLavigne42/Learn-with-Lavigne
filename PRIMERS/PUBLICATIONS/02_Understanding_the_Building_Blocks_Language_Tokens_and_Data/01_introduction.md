# Booklet Title
Understanding the Building Blocks: Language, Tokens, and Data

## Section Title
1. Introduction: The 'Lego Blocks' of AI Language

## url_slug
`primer/blocks-tokens-data`

## Short Question
What are the basic building blocks of AI language systems, and how should a beginner think about them?

## Long-Form Guidance Question
Provide a foundational, conceptual explanation of the *components* of an LLM, using simple, real-world metaphors. This prompt *must* follow the user's 'Beginner' rules: no code, no jargon. (1) You *must* use the 'Lego Blocks' analogy to explain 'tokens' (e.g., 'how an AI must break down a complex sentence ('a castle') into individual 'Lego pieces' ('words' or 'parts-of-words') to understand it'). (2) Explain 'data' using an analogy like 'the AI's library' or 'its collection of text and books'. (3) Differentiate 'structured' vs. 'unstructured' data using a simple metaphor (e.g., 'a perfectly organized spreadsheet' vs. 'a messy pile of notes and books'). (4) Explain 'model size' *without* using the word 'parameters' (e.g., 'the size of the AI's brain' or 'how much information it can hold at once'). (5) Explain 'fine-tuning' using the user's 'special lessons' analogy (e.g., 'the AI has read the whole library, but now we are giving it 'special lessons' by making it read *only* the 'medical' books 100 times').
