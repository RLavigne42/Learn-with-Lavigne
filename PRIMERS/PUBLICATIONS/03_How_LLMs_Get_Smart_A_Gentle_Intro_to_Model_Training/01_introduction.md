# Booklet Title
How LLMs Get Smart: A Gentle Intro to Model Training

## Section Title
1. Introduction: How an AI 'Practices' to Get Better

## url_slug
`primer/training-how-llms-learn`

## Short Question
How does an AI improve over time, and what can go wrong when it studies too much or too little?

## Long-Form Guidance Question
Provide a conceptual, analogy-rich overview of the 'training process' from a beginner's perspective. You *must not* use technical terms like 'gradient descent', 'backpropagation', or 'loss function'. (1) You *must* use the 'guess -> get feedback -> improve' loop as the core concept, using an analogy like 'a student practicing flashcards' (e.g., 'The AI 'guesses' the next word, the 'teacher' (the data) says 'no, this was the right word', and the AI 'corrects' its guess for next time'). (2) Explain *why* this takes so long (e.g., 'it's not practicing 100 flashcards, it's practicing *one trillion* of them'). (3) Explain 'overfitting' with a simple metaphor (e.g., 'the student *memorized* the *exact questions and answers* from the practice test, but never learned the *actual subject*, so they fail when asked a new question'). (4) Explain 'underfitting' (e.g., 'the student didn't study enough and fails all the questions'). (5) Explain 'forgetting' (e.g., 'after learning about medicine, the AI 'forgets' some of its knowledge about poetry').
