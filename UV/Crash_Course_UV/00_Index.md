# Crash Course: UV (Astral) — Index

Listen, listen. This track is the crisp, diabolical path from zero to shipping with UV, Astral’s **blazing-fast** Python package manager. You’re getting install, setup, and everyday workflows with no fluff, right?

## Modules

1. **Install + First Run**
   - Platform-specific install options
   - Verify the binary
   - Baseline config
2. **Core Workflow**
   - Create a project
   - Lock deps
   - Add/remove packages
3. **Everyday Power Moves**
   - Running scripts
   - Syncing environments
   - Using `uv pip`

## Outcomes (Vital)

- You can install UV on any machine without tripping over jabroni setup mistakes.
- You can build, lock, and run a Python project with a single clean command flow.
- You can explain when to use `uv pip` vs `uv sync`, like a certified chadastic operator.
