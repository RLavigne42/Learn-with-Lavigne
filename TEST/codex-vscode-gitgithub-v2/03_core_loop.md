# Module 03 — Core Loop

## Objective
Develop repeatable fluency in Create → Modify → Validate → Deliver.

## Standard Loop
1. **Create:** branch from updated `main`.
2. **Modify:** implement one small, coherent change.
3. **Validate:** run local checks (tests/lint/script).
4. **Deliver:** stage intentionally, commit clearly, push, open PR.

## Definition of Done
- Branch created from latest `main`
- Intentional staging confirmed with `git diff --staged`
- Commit follows convention
- Validation command passed
- PR opened with what/why/how-tested/risk sections

## 45-Minute Drill Protocol
- Run 5 repetitions.
- Target each loop at ≤ 9 minutes.
- On any failure, log root cause and recovery action before starting next repetition.

## Common Pitfalls
- Bundling unrelated edits in one commit
- Skipping validation due to “small” changes
- Vague PR descriptions without risk statement

## Assessment
Given a tiny feature request, deliver in exactly two meaningful commits and one reviewable PR.
