# Module 07 — Productivity System

## Objective
Turn ad-hoc Git usage into a repeatable, low-friction system.

## Workspace Organization
- Keep `.vscode/` tasks minimal and repo-safe.
- Store repeatable commands in project docs.
- Separate active branch work from experiments via dedicated scratch branches.

## Focus Workflow
1. Triage issue/task and define a one-sentence outcome.
2. Create branch using naming convention.
3. Implement in small checkpoints (commits every 15–30 min).
4. Validate before each push.
5. Keep PR concise and narrate tradeoffs.

## Noise Control
- Avoid mixing refactor + feature + docs in one commit.
- Disable unrelated formatters during focused bug-fix sessions.
- Use `git add -p` to stage intentionally.

## Weekly Maintenance
- Prune stale branches.
- Sync local `main`.
- Review aliases, templates, and failed-drill patterns.
