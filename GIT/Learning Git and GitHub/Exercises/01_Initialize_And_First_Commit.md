# Exercise 01: Initialize and First Commit

## Goal
Initialize a brand-new repository locally and create your first clean commit.

## Tasks
1. Create a folder named `git-ex01` and enter it.
2. Initialize Git.
3. Create two files: `README.md` and `main.py`.
4. Add a short project description in `README.md` and a simple print statement in `main.py`.
5. Stage both files and create a commit with an imperative message.
6. Verify commit history.

## Success Criteria
- `git status` shows a clean working tree.
- `git log --oneline` shows exactly one commit.
