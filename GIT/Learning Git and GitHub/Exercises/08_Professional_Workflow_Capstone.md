# Exercise 08: Professional Workflow Capstone

## Goal
Simulate the full professional feature workflow from issue to PR.

## Tasks
1. Clone or initialize a small project.
2. Create branch `feature/add-cli-summary`.
3. Implement a small improvement (e.g., add a CLI flag and tests/docs update).
4. Make at least two clean commits with imperative messages.
5. Rebase or merge latest `main` into your branch.
6. Resolve any conflicts.
7. Push branch and draft a PR description including:
   - Problem statement
   - Solution summary
   - Testing steps
8. Add one reviewer note in the PR body describing trade-offs.

## Success Criteria
- Branch is up to date with `main`.
- PR is review-ready with clear testing evidence.
- Commit messages are concise and meaningful.
