# Exercise 02: Clone and Remotes

## Goal
Practice cloning and verifying remote configuration.

## Tasks
1. Create an empty repository on your Git provider.
2. Clone it locally.
3. Verify remotes with `git remote -v`.
4. Add a `README.md`, commit it, and push with upstream tracking.
5. Confirm your commit appears in the cloud UI.

## Success Criteria
- `git remote -v` displays `origin`.
- Push succeeds using `git push -u origin main` (or your active default branch).
