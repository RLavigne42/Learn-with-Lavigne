# 00 — Introduction & Installation

## Section Goal
Set the stage: what Git is, and whether it is installed correctly.

## Commands

### `git --version` (Verification)
- `N/A` — Confirm Git is installed and verify version compatibility.

### `git help` (Getting Unstuck)
- `<command>` — Example: `git help commit`; opens the manual for a specific command.
- `-a` — Lists all available Git commands.

## Quick Win
If `git --version` works and `git help -a` lists commands, your machine is ready for the rest of the course.
