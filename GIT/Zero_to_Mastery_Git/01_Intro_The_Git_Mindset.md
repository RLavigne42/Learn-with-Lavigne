# Introduction: The Git Mindset in the Agentic Era

## The Shift to Agentic Engineering

In the traditional Git mindset, the developer is the sole author of every commit. In 2026, the "Git Mindset" evolves to **Agentic Engineering**, where developers act as architects who orchestrate AI agents to perform the heavy lifting.

- **From Typing to Steering:** Instead of writing every line, you define the *intent* and let the agent manage the *syntax*.
- **Asynchronous Development:** You no longer block your terminal for long tasks. You delegate work to an agent that runs in a background thread or cloud container.

## The Three Surfaces

Your Git workflow now spans three interfaces:

1. **VS Code Insiders:** For real-time "Vibe Coding" and rapid iteration.
2. **Copilot CLI:** For headless automation and quick context queries in the terminal.
3. **Codex App (macOS):** For managing long-running, parallel agent sessions using Git worktrees.
