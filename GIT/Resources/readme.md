# Resources Library Guide

This `readme.md` is a **navigator** for the Markdown training and reference docs in `GIT/Resources`.

It is designed to help you quickly decide:
- what each document covers,
- how deep/technical it is,
- and **why to read one document vs. another**.

For expanded synopses + extracted heading TOCs for each source file, use:
- [`MD_Synopses/README.md`](./MD_Synopses/README.md)

## Notes

- The `Git_AI_Agents_Repo_Management/Thread_Captures/` files are source conversation captures and are best used as historical context rather than primary operating guidance.
- For heading-level TOCs and expanded per-file orientation, use [`MD_Synopses/README.md`](./MD_Synopses/README.md).
