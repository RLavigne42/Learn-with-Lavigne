# SPEC.md — Complete Git Command Mastery

## Objective
Build a command-first, multi-volume Git course under `GIT/Complete_Git_Command_Mastery`.

## Deliverables
- `framework.json` as the canonical archive and content map.
- Root `README.md` with course TOC, URI links, and volume synopses.
- 3 volume folders, each with:
  - `README.md` containing TOC, URI links, and section-level command synopses.
  - Section markdown files defined by `framework.json`.
- `SPEC.md` and `PLAN.md` for architecture and execution tracking.

## Content Requirements
- Prioritize command usage, syntax patterns, and practical command intent.
- Keep narrative concise and avoid filler.
- Preserve section filenames from the JSON framework.
- Keep the structure stable for future automation/parsing.

## Non-Goals (Phase 1)
- Hands-on labs and long-form prose.
- Platform-specific screenshots.
- Deep conceptual essays beyond command context needed for usage.
