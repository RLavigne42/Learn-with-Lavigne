# 01 — Intro: The Git Mindset (Tenure Hook)

I’ve logged thousands of commits across teams and repos. I know everyone says “just memorize commands,” but that’s surface-level noise. I guarantee you’ll learn a mechanic you didn’t know existed.

## Git Is Two Things at Once (Two-for-One)
- **History:** Every commit is a time-stamped snapshot.
- **Safety:** Every commit is a rollback point.

Same effort, double value. That’s juicy efficiency.

## The Core Loop (Staccato-Flow)
1. **Edit** your files.
2. **Stage** the exact changes you want tracked.
3. **Commit** a snapshot with a message.

Everything else in Git is just a power-up for this loop. That’s the whole game, right?

## The Binary Filter (Vital vs Trash)
- **Vital:** Knowing what’s staged, what’s committed, what’s not.
- **Trash:** Hiding behind magic buttons you don’t understand.

Listen, man, listen. If you can’t explain what your tool does, you’re just mashing buttons.
