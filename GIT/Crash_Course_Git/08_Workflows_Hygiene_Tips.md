# 08 — Workflows, Hygiene, Tips (Noob Trap Avoidance)

## Daily Flow (Staccato-Flow)
1. `git status`
2. Edit files
3. `git add <files>`
4. `git commit -m "message"`
5. `git push origin <branch>`

This is the loop. Stay crisp.

## Branch Naming (Clean Signals)
- `feature/short-description`
- `fix/bug-name`
- `chore/dependency-update`

If your branch name is a mystery, your intent is trash.

## Commit Messages That Don’t Suck
- **Bad:** “update”
- **Good:** “Add pricing table to landing page”

Tell future-you what changed. That’s free value.

## Pull Before You Push (Mythbust)
Always pull before you push. It reduces conflicts and keeps the timeline clean.

## The One Command That Saves You
`git status` is your guardian angel. Run it constantly. It never lies. That’s the statistical salvation argument, right?
