## Course Variants

Learn with Lavigne ships two complementary presentation styles for the same curriculum, aligned to the Synthetic Semantic Framework guides:

- **Crash Course (Influencer Mode / Expert-Bro Dialectic):** High-energy, personality-driven delivery with hyper-casual authority, staccato pacing, and slang-forward emphasis on “vital vs trash” takeaways. Built for fast engagement and strong retention through punchy, confident framing.
- **Zero-to-Mastery (Presentation Framework):** Structured, calm, and systematic instruction that opens with a clear value proposition, builds a mental model, and verifies each step with explicit checks and gotchas. Built for clarity, reliability, and a smooth beginner-to-pro progression.
