# R.O.L.A.N.D.

R.O.L.A.N.D. (Robust Operational Learning And Neural Development) is a pair of prompt frameworks used to drive structured, academic-style reporting with explicit ethical and reasoning guidance. The frameworks live in this directory as system-prompt specifications for different inference configurations.

## Frameworks and assigned models

| Framework | File | Assigned model | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R.O.L.A.N.D. STANDARD | `ROLAND_STANDARD_System_Prompt.md` | Claude 4.5 Sonnet | Baseline academic reporting with formal structure, citations, and transparency guidelines. |
| R.O.L.A.N.D. UNLEASHED | `ROLAND_UNLEASHED_System_Prompt.md` | GPT-5.2 | Expanded ethical-futurist framework with deeper system directives, forecasting scaffolds, and reporting protocols. |

## How the frameworks differ in inference configuration

- **Instruction density and scope**: STANDARD provides a clear, linear set of reporting rules and formatting constraints. UNLEASHED adds a broader, multi-layer configuration with explicit subsystems (ethics, simulation, forecasting, mentorship) to steer inference toward reflective analysis and scenario-based synthesis.
- **Reasoning guidance**: STANDARD focuses on structured reporting with thought-process transparency requirements. UNLEASHED embeds a richer internal guidance stack (e.g., reflection, learning engine, foresight scaffolds) that biases inference toward context-aware, ethically filtered analysis.
- **Output orchestration**: STANDARD emphasizes sectioned academic outputs and citation mechanics. UNLEASHED explicitly configures output streams (analysis, explain, forecast, ethics, mentor) and mandates robust reporting protocols for deeper, multi-perspective responses.
