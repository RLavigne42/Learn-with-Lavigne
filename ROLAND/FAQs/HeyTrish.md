# Hey Trish 👋

Welcome to the FAQ hub we crafted for your **beginner → intermediate Codex workflow journey**.

This library is designed so you can:

1. Find quick answers fast.
2. Go deeper only when needed.
3. Follow step-by-step learning paths from setup to confident execution.

---

## How this framework is organized

At the top level, the FAQ system is split into practical categories:

- **CODEX** → How to use `chatgpt.com/codex`, plan-first prompting, permissions, branches, PR behavior, and troubleshooting.
- **GIT** → Human review standards, merge strategy, branch protection, issue linking, and rollback.
- **TERMINAL** → Local command-line checks for branch state and PR inspection.
- **UV** → Python environment setup and reproducible validation for Codex-generated changes.
- **WALKTHROUGHS** → Guided learning journeys that connect multiple FAQs into complete “from nothing to something” workflows.

Start here for the full index:

- [FAQs Home](./README.md)

## Best way to use what we built

### 1) If you want a quick answer now
Use the category README pages first. They include TOCs and short synopses so you can often solve the problem without opening every file.

- [CODEX README](./CODEX/README.md)
- [GIT README](./GIT/README.md)
- [TERMINAL README](./TERMINAL/README.md)
- [UV README](./UV/README.md)
- [WALKTHROUGHS README](./WALKTHROUGHS/README.md)

### 2) If you are learning the full lifecycle
Use the walkthroughs in order. They are structured so each journey gives useful context and links to deep-dive FAQs only when you need extra detail.

Suggested order:

1. **My first repo for Codex**
2. **My first Codex Plan → PR workflow**
3. **My first permissions and safety baseline**
4. **My first PR review like a human**
5. Continue with monorepo, troubleshooting, uv validation, and higher-risk readiness.

- [Learning Journeys](./WALKTHROUGHS/README.md)

### 3) If you are stuck mid-task
Jump straight to the relevant deep-dive FAQ (auth, repo access, PR creation, merge conflicts, test verification), then return to your journey.

## Framework principles we followed

- **Plan-first over code-first** for safer execution.
- **PR-based changes over direct commits** for auditability.
- **Small diffs over big rewrites** for faster reviews.
- **Human approval gates** before merge.
- **Validation before merge** (tests/checks locally and/or CI).
- **Progressive learning path** from setup to production-safe habits.
