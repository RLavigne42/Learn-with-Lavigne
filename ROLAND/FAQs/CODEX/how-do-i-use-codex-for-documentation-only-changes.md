## How do I use Codex for documentation-only changes?

For low-risk onboarding, docs-only PRs are ideal. Restrict Codex to markdown paths and explicitly block code edits.

### Suggested constraints

- “Only modify `README.md` and `docs/**`.”
- “No source code or config changes.”
- “Add before/after summary in PR body.”

### Good first tasks

- Setup instructions.
- Troubleshooting section.
- Contributor workflow notes.
