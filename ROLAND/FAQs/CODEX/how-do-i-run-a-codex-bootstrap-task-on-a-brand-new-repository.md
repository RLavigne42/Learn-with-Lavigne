## How do I run a Codex bootstrap task on a brand-new repository?

Use a tiny first PR to prove read, write, and review flow works.

### Bootstrap sequence

1. Ensure repo has `README.md` and default branch.
2. Open repo in Codex and request plan-only.
3. Approve implementation on `codex/bootstrap`.
4. Add one small file (for example `CONTRIBUTING.md`).
5. Open PR, review, merge.

This validates the full lifecycle with minimal risk.
