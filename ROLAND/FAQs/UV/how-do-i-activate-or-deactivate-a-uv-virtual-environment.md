## How do I activate or deactivate a uv virtual environment?

Once the environment is set up, your workflow typically comes down to two commands: one to activate it and one to deactivate it.

1. **Activate**  
   Run this inside your project folder to “turn on” your environment:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

   Your terminal prompt will change to indicate the environment is active.

2. **Deactivate**  
   When you are finished working, run:

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

   Your terminal prompt will return to normal.
