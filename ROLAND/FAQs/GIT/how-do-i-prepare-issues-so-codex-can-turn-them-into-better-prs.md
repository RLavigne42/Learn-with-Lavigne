## How do I prepare issues so Codex can turn them into better PRs?

High-quality issue definitions produce better Codex output.

### Include in each issue

- Problem statement and expected outcome.
- Constraints (performance, API compatibility, style).
- Acceptance criteria.
- Test expectations.
- Non-goals (what not to change).

Codex performs best when scope is explicit and measurable.
