## How do I review a Codex PR like a human code reviewer?

Review Codex PRs with the same rigor as human contributions.

### Reviewer checklist

1. Verify scope matches the request.
2. Check for unintended file changes.
3. Validate tests and CI results.
4. Inspect security-sensitive code paths.
5. Confirm docs/changelog updates where needed.

If unclear, request a smaller follow-up commit before approving.
