## How do I link Codex PRs to issues and release notes?

Add issue references and release notes tags directly in PR titles/bodies.

### Recommended pattern

- PR title: `[codex] <scope>: <summary>`
- PR body: `Fixes #123` and “Release notes” section.
- Include testing and rollback notes.

This improves traceability from planning through release.
