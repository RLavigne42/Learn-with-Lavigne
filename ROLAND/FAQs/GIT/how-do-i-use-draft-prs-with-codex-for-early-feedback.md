## How do I use draft PRs with Codex for early feedback?

Draft PRs are ideal when you want visibility before final polish.

### Suggested flow

1. Ask Codex to open a **draft PR** after first implementation pass.
2. Collect reviewer feedback early.
3. Ask Codex to address comments on the same branch.
4. Mark ready for review when checks pass.

This reduces rework and shortens final review cycles.
