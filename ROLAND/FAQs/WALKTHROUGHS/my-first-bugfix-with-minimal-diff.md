## Learning Journey 6: My first bug fix with minimal diff

Use this for practical code changes while keeping review complexity low.

### Outcome
A focused bug fix PR with clear test validation.

### Steps
1. **Prepare a clear issue statement**
   - Provide repro steps, expected behavior, and constraints.
   - FAQ: [How do I prepare issues so Codex can turn them into better PRs?](../GIT/how-do-i-prepare-issues-so-codex-can-turn-them-into-better-prs.md)

2. **Ask for plan + validation strategy**
   - Require tests, risk notes, and rollback points.
   - FAQ: [How do I configure Codex prompts for plan, risk, validation, and rollback?](../CODEX/how-do-i-configure-codex-prompts-for-plan-risk-validation-and-rollback.md)

3. **Control PR size**
   - Split into multiple PRs if scope begins to grow.
   - FAQ: [How do I decide between one large PR and multiple Codex PRs?](../CODEX/how-do-i-decide-between-one-large-pr-and-multiple-codex-prs.md)
