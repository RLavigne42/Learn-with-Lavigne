## Learning Journey 1: My first repo for Codex (from zero to ready)

Use this when you are starting with no repository and want a clean setup Codex can access.

### Outcome
By the end, you will have a GitHub repository with a `README.md`, Codex access enabled, and a validated first repo connection.

### Steps
1. **Create and initialize your repo**
   - Create a new repository in GitHub and initialize with `README.md`.
   - If needed, use the CLI flow to create local files and push first commit.
   - FAQ: [How do I create a fresh GitHub repository for Codex and initialize it with a README.md?](../CODEX/how-do-i-create-a-fresh-github-repository-for-codex-and-initialize-it-with-a-readme.md)

2. **Connect authentication for Codex**
   - Connect GitHub in `chatgpt.com/codex`.
   - Confirm selected-repo vs all-repo permission settings.
   - FAQ: [How do I authenticate my GitHub repository for Codex usage in chatgpt.com/codex?](../CODEX/how-do-i-authenticate-my-github-repository-for-codex-usage-in-chatgpt-codex.md)

3. **Confirm the repo appears in Codex**
   - Open Codex repo picker and select your new repo.
   - If repo is missing, verify integration scope and SSO (if org-owned repo).
   - FAQ: [What is the next step after creating a repo + README.md to connect it to Codex and run a first “Plan → PR” task?](../CODEX/what-is-the-next-step-after-creating-a-repo-and-readme-to-connect-it-to-codex-and-run-a-first-plan-to-pr-task.md)
