## Learning Journey 5: My first docs-only Codex change

Use this when you want a low-risk way to learn Codex branch + PR workflows.

### Outcome
A small documentation PR that is easy to review and merge.

### Steps
1. **Scope task to docs only**
   - Restrict edits to README/docs paths.
   - FAQ: [How do I use Codex for documentation-only changes?](../CODEX/how-do-i-use-codex-for-documentation-only-changes.md)

2. **Request a tiny PR**
   - Ask for minimal diff and one clear goal.
   - FAQ: [How do I ask Codex for smaller, more reviewable PRs?](../CODEX/how-do-i-ask-codex-for-smaller-and-more-reviewable-prs.md)

3. **Link to issue/release notes (optional)**
   - Useful if docs changes are tied to a feature or bug release.
   - FAQ: [How do I link Codex PRs to issues and release notes?](../GIT/how-do-i-link-codex-prs-to-issues-and-release-notes.md)
