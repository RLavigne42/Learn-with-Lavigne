# Intro to Prompting: Talking to AI Effectively

## Final Output — 1. Introduction: The 'Recipe' for a Good AI Answer

A good prompt is like a good recipe: clear ingredients, clear steps, clear outcome.

### Bad vs Good Example
**Bad:** “Explain AI.”

**Good:** “Explain AI to a 12-year-old in 150 words, using one sports analogy and one real-life example.”

Why the second works better: it defines audience, length, and style.

### Give the AI a Role
Example: “You are a patient tutor helping a beginner.”
This sets tone and behavior.

### Add Constraints
Useful constraints include:
- length (e.g., 5 bullets),
- tone (friendly, formal, technical),
- audience (beginner, manager, developer),
- format (table, checklist, summary).

### Provide an Output Template
If you want consistency, show a format.
Example:
1. Definition
2. Example
3. Common mistake
4. Quick tip

### Iterate
Great prompting is iterative.
If the first answer is close, refine:
- “Make this simpler.”
- “Add one example from healthcare.”
- “Shorten to 100 words.”

Prompting is less about magic phrases and more about clear instructions.
The clearer your request, the better the response.
