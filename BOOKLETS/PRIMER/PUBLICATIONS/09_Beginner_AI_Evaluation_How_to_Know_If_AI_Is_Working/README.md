# Beginner AI Evaluation: How to Know If AI Is Working

## Final Output — 1. Introduction: How to 'Fact-Check' Your AI

Use this simple beginner checklist whenever you read an AI answer.

1. **Plausibility check**
   Does this sound realistic, or too perfect to be true?

2. **Relevance check**
   Did it answer your actual question, or drift into something else?

3. **Verification check**
   Can you confirm key claims from trustworthy sources?
   If links/citations are provided, open them and verify.

What are hallucinations?
They are confident-sounding statements that are incorrect or invented.
This happens because AI predicts likely text; it does not automatically guarantee truth.

A useful self-critique prompt:
“Are you sure this is correct? Double-check your facts, list uncertain points, and tell me where verification is needed.”

You can also ask:
- “What are the top 3 risks this answer could be wrong?”
- “Which part should I verify first?”

Beginner rule:
Treat AI as a fast draft assistant, not an unquestionable authority—especially for medical, legal, financial, or high-stakes decisions.
