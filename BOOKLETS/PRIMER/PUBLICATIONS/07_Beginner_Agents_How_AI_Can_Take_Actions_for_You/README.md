# Beginner Agents: How AI Can Take Actions for You

## Final Output — 1. Introduction: Giving the AI 'Hands' to Help You

A normal chat AI is like a brain without hands.
It can think in words, but it cannot directly do things in the world.

An agent is the same brain connected to tools (the hands).
Those tools might include:
- web search,
- calculator,
- calendar,
- email drafting/sending.

Example workflow:
User asks: “What’s the weather in Paris and email it to my mom.”

Agent steps:
1. Use weather/search tool to get current forecast.
2. Read result and summarize clearly.
3. Use email tool to draft a message.
4. Show draft for review.

Human approval is the safety latch.
Before final actions (like actually sending an email), the system should wait for your confirmation.

Why this matters:
- it reduces accidental actions,
- keeps humans accountable,
- and makes automation safer.

So the jump from chatbot to agent is simple:
from “answering” to “answering + doing,” with human approval at critical steps.
