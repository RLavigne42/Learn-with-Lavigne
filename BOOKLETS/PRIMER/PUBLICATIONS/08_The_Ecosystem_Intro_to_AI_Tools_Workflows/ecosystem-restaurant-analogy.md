# The Ecosystem: Intro to AI Tools & Workflows

## Final Output — 1. Introduction: The 'AI Restaurant' - What Happens Behind the Scenes

Use a restaurant analogy:
- **App = Menu** (what you see and choose from)
- **API = Waiter** (carries your order/request)
- **Model = Kitchen** (where the meal/answer is prepared)

You type a prompt in the app (menu interaction).
The API (waiter) carries it to the model (kitchen).
The model prepares the response, and the waiter brings it back.

Cloud vs Local:
- **Cloud** is like a giant professional kitchen: very powerful, fast, and scalable.
- **Local** is like cooking in your own home kitchen: more private and controlled, but often slower and smaller.

Enterprise vs Personal AI:
- **Enterprise AI** is a kitchen serving an entire city: high scale, many users, strict operations.
- **Personal AI** is a kitchen for a household: tailored to one person or small team.

This mental model helps beginners understand where each piece fits and why product choices differ by power, privacy, and scale.
