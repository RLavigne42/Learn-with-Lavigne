# Understanding the Building Blocks: Language, Tokens, and Data

## 1. Introduction: The 'Lego Blocks' of AI Language

- **url_slug:** `primer/blocks-tokens-data`

### Short Question
What are the basic building blocks of AI language systems, and how should a beginner think about them?

### Long-Form Question
Provide a foundational, conceptual explanation of LLM components with simple metaphors and no code/jargon. Must include: 1. 'Lego Blocks' analogy for tokens. 2. Data as the AI's library/collection of books. 3. Structured vs unstructured data (organized spreadsheet vs messy notes/books). 4. Model size without using the word 'parameters' (e.g., size of AI brain / capacity). 5. Fine-tuning as 'special lessons' on focused subject matter.
