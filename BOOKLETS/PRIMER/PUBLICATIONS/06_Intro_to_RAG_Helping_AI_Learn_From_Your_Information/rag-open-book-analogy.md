# Intro to RAG: Helping AI Learn From Your Information

## Final Output — 1. Introduction: The 'Open-Book Test' for AI

Think of two exam types:
- closed-book test: memory only,
- open-book test: memory plus reference material.

This approach is the open-book version for AI.
Instead of relying only on what it already knows, it can look at your documents before answering.

How it works in plain language:
1. A long document is split into smaller chunks (like cutting a textbook into handy note cards).
2. When a question is asked, the system searches those chunks for the most relevant parts.
3. It uses those selected parts to build the final answer.

Why this helps:
- better grounding in your real materials,
- more accurate domain-specific answers,
- easier traceability to source passages.

For private teams, this is especially useful.
The AI can answer from internal docs, policies, and knowledge bases instead of only general internet-like knowledge.

Citations are a major benefit.
A good answer can point to where it came from (“this came from section X of document Y”), which makes review and trust much easier.

In short: open-book AI answers are usually stronger because they are supported by relevant reference text at answer time.
