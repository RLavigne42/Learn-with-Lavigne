## 1. Introduction: How an AI 'Practices' to Get Better

- **url_slug:** `primer/training-how-llms-learn`

### Short Question
How does an AI improve through practice, and what happens when it studies too little or too narrowly?

### Long-Form Question
Provide a beginner-friendly conceptual overview of training using analogies and without technical optimization terms. Must include: 1. Guess → feedback → improve loop (flashcard student analogy). 2. Why training takes so long (massive scale of practice). 3. Overfitting as memorizing test answers without understanding. 4. Underfitting as not studying enough. 5. Forgetting after new focused learning.
